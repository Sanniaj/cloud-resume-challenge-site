            <p>
                Hi! I’m Sannia Jean, a Computer Science student at California State University, Northridge (expected
                graduation: May 2026). I’m passionate about building practical, scalable tech, whether it’s through
                writing scripts, configuring infrastructure, or designing cloud native solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey into tech began in high school, where I was part of a coding pathway program that introduced
                me to the fundamentals of web development. We started with HTML and CSS, moved into JavaScript, and
                eventually into Python, where I began exploring logic, scripting, and real world problem solving. Along
                the way, I also learned how to integrate APIs, allowing me to build more dynamic and connected web
                experiences.
            </p>

            <p>
                That early exposure led me to pursue Computer Science in college, where I’ve continued expanding my
                skills in areas like Linux, cloud computing, and DevOps. I’m currently learning AWS, Docker, and
                improving my ability to build applications that communicate across systems and scale reliably. Whether
                it’s containerizing apps, working at the command line, or architecting cloud workflows, I enjoy being
                close to the foundation of how things work.
            </p>

            <p>
                I’m actively preparing for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam and plan to pursue many more
                certifications in the future, including in areas like DevOps, security, cloud architecture, and
                automation. These credentials will support my goal of becoming a highly skilled systems or
                infrastructure engineer, with a strong foundation in both practice and theory.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m also a strong believer in using technology for positive impact. I’m drawn to inclusive tech spaces
                and initiatives that help diversify STEM, especially for underrepresented groups. Outside of school, I
                spend time refining my tools, contributing to projects, and staying engaged with the tech community.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the near future, I plan to pursue a Master’s degree in Computer Science or a related field to further
                specialize in infrastructure engineering, cloud systems, or embedded computing. My long-term goal is to
                work in roles that combine systems level thinking with cloud architecture, and to use my knowledge to
                mentor others and make tech more accessible.
            </p>
